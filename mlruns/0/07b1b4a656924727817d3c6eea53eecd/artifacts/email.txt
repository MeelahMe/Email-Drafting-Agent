Subject: Timeline Update & Risk Assessment

Good evening, Project Stakeholders,

I wanted to let you know about Timeline update & risk assessment.

Milestones: Design freeze — July 5, Development complete — August 15, User testing — Sept 1–Sept 15, and Go-live — October 1.

Dependencies: Backend API readiness, Third-party vendor approval, and Legal sign-off on TOS.

Risks: resource constraints, vendor delays, and regulatory changes.

Sincerely,
Ana
