Subject: Review Api Changes And Share Sample Payload

Good evening, Backend Team,

I wanted to let you know about Review API changes and share sample payload.

Changes: Added POST /v2/users endpoint, Request body now requires email_verified: boolean, Deprecates username field in response, and Updated error codes for 400 Bad Request.

Sample payload: {"email": "user@example.com" and "email_verified": true}.

EOD Monday (June 30â€“July 1).

Sincerely,
Ana
