Subject: Review Api Changes, Share Sample Payload, & And Update Docs

Good morning, Backend Team and QA & DevOps,

I wanted to let you know about Review API changes, share sample payload, and update docs.

Changes: Added `POST /v2/users` endpoint, Request body now requires `email_verified: boolean`, Must log timestamp in ISO format, Default to `false` if missing, Deprecates `username` field in response, Error codes revamped for 400, 401, 403, and Rate limits set to 1000 RPM.

```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "email_verified": true,
    "roles": ["user","admin"]
  }
  ```
• Docs update: see `docs/api_v2.md` for full spec
• Deadline: EOD Friday (UTC−07:00).

Sincerely,
Ana
