Subject: Review API Changes, Share Sample Payload, & And Update Docs

Good afternoon, Backend Team and QA & DevOps,

I'm writing to review the API changes, share the sample payload, and and update docs.

Changes:

- Added `POST /v2/users` endpoint.

- Request body now requires `email_verified: boolean`.

- Must log timestamp in ISO format.

- Default to `false` if missing.

- Deprecates `username` field in response.

- Error codes revamped for 400, 401, 403.

- Rate limits set to 1,000 RPM.

```json
{
"email": "user@example.com",
"email_verified": true,
"roles": ["user","admin"]
}
```
• Docs update: see `docs/api_v2.md` for full spec
• Deadline: EOD Friday (UTC−07:00).

Sincerely,
Ana
